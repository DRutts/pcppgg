    <h4>Matchings</h4>
    <p>
        The study consists of a series of rounds. In each round, you will be matched with the same group consisting of all 4 participants, i.e. you and 3 other players. The decisions that you and the other players make will determine the amounts earned by each of you.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Contributions</h4>
    <p>
        You begin each round with an endowment "tokens," which may either be kept or contributed to a project. These tokens will be converted to dollars at the end of the study. The 3 players you are matched with will decide how many of their tokens to keep, and how many to contribute to the project. You will be not be able to see the others' decisions until after your decision is submitted. You will have 60 seconds to make these decisions. If you fail to make the decision within the 60 second time limit, your contribution will be randomly selected between 0 and 20 and you will not receive any payment for that round. This applies to all players.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Earnings</h4>
    <p>
        The payoff to you will equal:
        <ul>
            <li>1 token for each token you keep</li>
            <li>0.4 tokens for each token you contribute</li>
            <li>0.4 tokens for each token contributed by the 3 other players who you are matched with</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: All players receive the same payment from the contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Subsequent Matchings</h4>
    <p>
        You will be in the same group of 4 participants in all subsequent rounds, so the 3 other players you are matched with in one round are the same players that you are matched with in the next round. The player indices will not necessarily remain the same in all rounds. For example, in round 1, you may be labeled ‘player 1’, while in round 2, you may be labeled ‘player 3’.
