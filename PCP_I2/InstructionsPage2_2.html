    <h4>Deduction Points</h4>
    <p>
      After revealing the contribution decisions to everyone, you may send up to 10 deduction points to the other players. If you send no points, the cost to you is $0, and every additional point that you send will cost 1 token. The other players can also send points to you, and their sending cost is determined in the same manner. You will have 120 seconds to make these decisions. If you fail to make the decisions within the 120 second time limit, you will automatically assign 0 deduction points to all other players and you will not receive any payment for that round. This applies to all players.

    <h4>Effect of Points Received</h4>
    <p>
      Whoever receives deduction points has their earnings for the round reduced by 3 tokens for every deduction point they receive. For example, if you send 1 deduction point, the other's earnings will be reduced by 3 tokens. When you receive deduction points, your earnings are reduced in the same manner.

    <h4>Earnings Adjustment</h4>
    <p>
      If you send deduction points, the cost of all deduction points that you send will be deducted from your earnings. If you receive deduction points, your earnings (after costs have been deducted) will be reduced by 3 tokens for every point received.
