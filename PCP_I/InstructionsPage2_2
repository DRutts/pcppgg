    <h4>Deduction Points</h4>
    <p>
      After contribution decisions for both of you are revealed at the end of the round, you may send up to 10 deduction points to the other players. If you send no points, the cost to you is $0, and every additional point that you send will cost 1 token. The other players can also send points to you, and their sending cost is determined in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Effect of Points Received</h4>
    <p>
      Whoever receives points has their earnings for the round reduced by 3 tokens for every point they receive. For example, if you send 1 point, the other's earnings will be reduced by 3 tokens. When you receive points, your earnings are reduced in the same manner.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>Earnings Adjustment</h4>
    <p>
      If you send points, the cost of all points that you send will be deducted from your earnings. If you receive points, your earnings (after costs have been deducted) will be reduced by 3 tokens for every point received.
    </p>
    <h4>Comprehension Question</h4>
    <p>
      Suppose that, in the second phase, you send 9, 5, and 0 deduction points to the other three players, respectively. What is the total cost of the deduction points you sent?
