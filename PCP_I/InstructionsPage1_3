    <p>
        Suppose you have 20 tokens for the round, and the earnings from tokens kept, contributed, and contributed by the others are 10, 5, and 5 respectively. 
        <ul>
            <li>If you keep all 20 tokens, then your earnings will be: 20 from the tokens kept, plus 0.4 times the number of tokens contributed by the other players in your group. </li>
            <li>If you contribute all tokens, then your earnings will be: 0.4 * 20 = 8 from the tokens contributed, plus 0.4 times the number of tokens contribute by the other players in your group. </li>
            <li>If you keep 10 and contribute 10, then your earnings will be: 10 * 1 = 10 from the token kept, plus 10 x 0.4 = 4 for the token contributed, plus 0.4 times the number of tokens contributed by the other players in your group.</li>
